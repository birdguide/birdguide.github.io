    Let's say you have just summited Mt. Everest around midnight. While this may be an impressive accomplishment, you remember that around 4000 other people have also done it. Not feeling so cool now, huh? Disheartened, you look up into the beautiful night sky and cry, "<i>God, how can I be impressive?</i>" because you believe in God. Then, a deep, daunting voice from within you says, "<i>Hello.</i>" Shortly afterwards, you see a <b>bald eagle the size of 5 galaxies</b> flying overhead, blocking the stars! No one's ever seen this bird before. Suddenly the voice says, "<i>If you can correctly name this bird, then I will let you live. However, if you can't name it, then I shall-</i>" The voice pauses for dramatic effect. "<i>-kill you!</i>" Befuddled by the threat, you blindly guess: "<i>umm... super-bald eagle?</i>" <br>"<i>WRONG!! If you had been able to correctly identify birds that have never been seen before, like Ethan Hsiao, then you would have lived. Too bad you never came across his written guide; it's quite good.</i>" The "super-bald eagle" then swoops towards you, and your final thought is about the weather.

    About Ornithology
  </h2>
  <p>
    People who call themselves ornithologists tend to be egocentric and pretentious in nature. When I think of the word "ornithologist," an image of a ridiculously ugly asian kid dressed in guady clothing pops up in my head. To the left is an image of a typical ornithologist for the more curious readers. The thing is, ornithologists identify birds by memory&mdash;<i>this is absolutely wrong</i>. I realize how tedious this is, so I want to promulgate the <b>easy, correct way</b>.

      </ul>
    <p>
      These guides are run by typical, lame ornithologists who don't know my secret. To put it metaphorically, they are doing long-term division without a calculator. Except, in our case, the "calculator" of bird identification is <i>already within you</i>.

      This section is gratuitous; my method simply <i>works</i>. However, some people still ask for it to be kept because of the impossibly vivacious, sparkling face of the man who survived&mdash;actually, I'll just let you read his story below.
